# Inverse-and-Wiener-Filtering
"A Python project demonstrating image restoration using Inverse and Wiener filtering. Simulates motion blur and Gaussian noise, evaluates performance across four cases (low/high blur &amp; noise), and computes MSE, PSNR, and SSIM metrics with visual comparisons of restored image"
